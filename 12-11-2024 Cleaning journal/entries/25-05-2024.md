Daddy Jesus today You've given us this man, i don't know his name but You know Father GOD, he was playing some shooter game where his character was holding an assault rifle in hands and was flying on a helicopter somewhere in the forest 
and so that guy had a beard and was most likely American, and we preached to him
and he kept telling us that he believes in the Lord his own way
he never called you by name Daddy Jesus, that's strange
i wanted to ask him what Lord does he mean, who is his Lord 
but God told me not to do it to not provoke him
Father GOD i hope it was the right decision
but yeah anyways we preached there a bit
and please Lord Jesus use our little effort there to bring that man to repentance
please Daddy Jesus save his soul
he has some anger issues Daddy Jesus i assume so please Daddy Jesus take it away from him
please Father GOD help him Lord Jesus and save his soul Daddy Jesus 
please Father Jesus im begging You Lord GOD save all people please Lord Jesus save all people Father GOD
in Jesus Holy Name we pray Lord GOD Amen
thank You so much Father Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty for listening, i know You always listen Daddy Jesus and i wanna spend more time with You like that Father GOD
