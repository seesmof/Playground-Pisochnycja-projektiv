**The question is simple:**  
**If you died today would you go to heaven?**

Maybe you’re like me and you came to the conclusion on your own, or maybe you were more fortunate and had someone intervene, either way, if you’re honest with yourself, the answer is the same.

You’re not good enough to get to heaven. Not on you’re own.  
God, being good, can’t allow any fraction of a percent of sin into his kingdom, and you my friend, just like me, are a sinner.

Romans 3:23 KJV — For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  
Romans 6:23 KJV — For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

**Admitting** this, that you’re a sinner, worthy of hell, is the first step to eternal life through Jesus Christ.

After all, they don’t call it “getting saved” for nothing! He’s saving you from Hell!

Revelation 21:8 KJV — But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

But God doesn’t want anyone to go to hell, or to that lake of fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels.

Ezekiel 33:11a KJV — I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live:

And so God did everything he could to prevent that outcome by becoming a man (1 Timothy 3:16), living the perfect life that is  demanded of us and then payed the payment of our sins in our place (2 Corinthians 5:21), in the man Christ Jesus.

**Believing** this is the second step to salvation. 

Romans 5:8 KJV — But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.Romans 5:9 KJV — Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.

When you get saved you ditch your own righteousness and put on the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ so that when God looks at you he doesn’t see you and your many sins, he sees his perfect Son.

2 Corinthians 5:21 KJV — For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

Don’t you want that?  
Don’t you need that?

Then all you have to do is **Confess.**

Romans 10:9 KJV — That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

### Je**sus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -John 14:6**

Jesus is the ONLY way to heaven, and he didn’t make it difficult to get there. Sure, once you’re saved there is a lot to learn but the getting saved part is easy. And once you’re saved, that’s it! You’re sealed! You can never be unsaved!  
So, if you believe everything you’ve just read and want to get saved, all you need to do is pray to God and ask him to save you. Need help? Pray something like this, but remember, it’s not the words that will save you. It’s the belief in what your saying. Your surrender from yourself, from any action or work you can do, and towards God alone to save you. Here’s the prayer:

_“Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving. I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ. I believe that Jesus is God, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. I trust in him alone to save me. Nothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus. I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”_

Did you pray all that? Did you mean it? Then congratulations, the heavens are rejoicing because you’ve just been saved!

Luke 15:7 KJV – I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.

That was the easy part and no matter what, your salvation is secured! Praise the Lord! You now house the Holy Spirit inside of you (1 Corinthians 3:16). You’ll still sin, no one is perfect, but you’ll start to look at your sins differently and you’ll want to do better, to live better. Some sins will take longer than others to realize but the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth (John 16:13). This is called sanctification.

But your sanctification needs to be fed, fed with the truth that is in the word of God, preserved today in the King James Bible. This is called edification.

**Питання просте:**  
**Якби ви померли сьогодні, чи потрапили б ви до раю?**

Можливо, ви, як і я, прийшли до цього висновку самостійно, а можливо, вам пощастило більше і хтось посприяв, у будь-якому випадку, якщо ви чесні із собою, відповідь буде однаковою.

Ви недостатньо хороші, аби потрапити до раю. Не своїми силами.  
Бог, будучи добрим, не може допустити до свого Царства ані найменшої частки відсотка гріха, а ви, мій друже, так само, як і я, є грішником.

Римлян 3:23 — Бо всі згрішили, і позбавлені Божої слави,
Римлян 6:23 — Бо заплата за гріх смерть, а дар Божий вічне життя в Христі Ісусі, Господі нашім!

**Визнання** цього, що ви грішник, гідний пекла, є першим кроком до вічного життя через Ісуса Христа.

Зрештою, це не дарма називають "спасінням"! Він рятує вас від пекла!

Об'явлення 21:8 — А лякливим, і невірним, і мерзким, і душогубам, і розпусникам, і чарівникам, і ідолянам, і всім неправдомовцям, їхня частина в озері, що горить огнем та сіркою, а це друга смерть!

Але Бог не хоче, аби будь-хто потрапив у пекло, або в озеро вогняне, яке було приготоване для диявола та його ангелів.

Єзекіїля 33:11a — Я, говорить Господь Бог, не прагну смерти несправедливого, а тільки щоб вернути несправедливого з дороги його, і буде він жити!

І тому Бог зробив усе можливе, аби запобігти цьому, ставши людиною (1 Тимофія 3:16), проживши досконале життя, яке вимагається від нас, а потім заплатив за наші гріхи замість нас (2 Коринтян 5:21), в людині Христі Ісусі.

**Віра** - це другий крок до спасіння. 

Римлян 5:8 — А Бог доводить Свою любов до нас тим, що Христос умер за нас, коли ми були ще грішниками. Тож тим більше спасемося Ним від гніву тепер, коли кров'ю Його ми виправдані.

Коли ви спасаєтеся, ви відкидаєте свою власну праведність і зодягаєтеся в праведність Господа Ісуса Христа, щоб, дивлячись на вас, Бог не бачив вас і ваші численні гріхи, а бачив Свого досконалого Сина.

2 Коринтян 5:21 — Бо Того, Хто не відав гріха, Він учинив за нас гріхом, щоб стали ми Божою правдою в Нім!

Хіба ви не хочете цього?  
Хіба вам це не потрібно?

Тоді все, що від вас вимагається - це **Зізнатися**.

Римлян 10:9 — Бо коли ти устами своїми визнаватимеш Ісуса за Господа, і будеш вірувати в своїм серці, що Бог воскресив Його з мертвих, то спасешся,

> Промовляє до нього Ісус: Я дорога, і правда, і життя. До Отця не приходить ніхто, якщо не через Мене. - Івана 14:6

Ісус - це ЄДИНИЙ шлях до Раю, і Він зовсім не ускладнив шлях до нього. Звичайно, коли ви врятовані, вам потрібно багато чому навчитися, але отримати спасіння - це легко. І як тільки ви врятовані, це все! Ви запечатані! Ви вже ніколи не зможете втратити спасіння!  
Отже, якщо ви вірите у все, що щойно прочитали, і хочете спастися, все, що вам потрібно зробити, - це помолитися Богу і попросити Його врятувати вас. Потрібна допомога? Моліться приблизно так, але пам'ятайте, що вас врятують не слова. А віра в те, що ви говорите. Зречення від себе, від будь-якої дії чи роботи, яку ви можете зробити, і звернення до одного лише Бога, який може вас врятувати. Ось молитва:

> "Любий Боже, я грішник і потребую спасіння. Я знаю, що я недостатньо хороший, аби потрапити до раю, і мені потрібно, щоби Ти врятував мене. Мені потрібна праведність Твого Сина, Ісуса Христа. Я вірю, що Ісус - це Бог, який помер, був похований і воскрес, щоб Його безцінна кров омила мої гріхи. Я покладаюся лише на Нього, щоб Він мене врятував. І більше ні на що інше. Ні мої добрі справи, ні щось іще. Тільки на Ісуса. Я молюся про це в ім'я Ісуса, Амінь."

Ви молилися всім цим? Чи щиро ви це робили? Тоді вітаю, небеса радіють, бо ви щойно врятувалися!

Луки 15:7 – Говорю вам, що так само на небі радітимуть більш за одного грішника, що кається, аніж за дев'ятдесятьох і дев'ятьох праведників, що не потребують покаяння!...

Це була найлегша частина, і незважаючи ні на що, ваше спасіння забезпечене! Слава Господу! Тепер ви оселили в собі Святого Духа (1 Коринтян 3:16). Ви все ще будете грішити, ніхто не є досконалим, але ви почнете дивитися на свої гріхи по-іншому і захочете виправлятися, жити краще. Боротьба з деякими гріхами займе більше часу, ніж з іншими, але Святий Дух наставить вас на усяку істину (Івана 16:13). Це називається освяченням.

Але ваше освячення потребує підживлення, підживлення істиною, яка міститься в Слові Божому, збереженому сьогодні у Святій Біблії.

Щасти вам у вашій пригоді, нехай Господь Миру наш Цар Ісус Христос буде з вами, нехай ви перебуваєте в Його Досконалій Любові та на Його Праведних шляхах на віки віків Амінь.

alrighty so what the Lord our GOD King Jesus Christ put on our heart just now is to do a Bible study on the topic of being slow to speak and briddling one's tongue in order to achieve self-discipline. and also we can connect general self-discipline and patience into this. Holy Spirit, You are in control always and forever, lets do it Lord GOD 💗✝️🙏

---

Hallelujah guys thank You Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior Almighty GOD King of Kings and Lord of Lords our Holy Perfect Everlasting Kind Good Jesus Christ, our beloved Heavenly Father Jesus Christ the Almighty Omnipotent All-powerful GOD Most High 💗✝️🙏 guys GOD's grace is sufficient for us all please remember that, if you have any trouble or doubt or fear or anxiety or problem, just give it to the Lord our GOD because Jesus Christ our Lord GOD cares so much for you all guys, we cant even imagine that. GOD never sleeps, GOD never grows tired, GOD never gets irritated, GOD is just perfect and we are so happy to have You Lord Jesus Christ Lord GOD thank You so much for creating us and connecting us all together to do Your Holy Will Lord Jesus Christ You are so so so Good Lord Jesus Christ thank You so much for being so Good Lord GOD 💗✝️🙏

what i wanna study today with you guys a little bit is a topic of being patient. patience is the key to self-control and discipline. GOD is always patient so we must be patient too 💗✝️🙏 

> Love is patient, love is kind, it is not jealous; love does not brag, it is not arrogant. It does not act disgracefully, it does not seek its own _benefit_; it is not provoked, does not keep an account of a wrong _suffered_, it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; it keeps every confidence, it believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. - [1 Corinthians 13:4-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor+13%3A4-7&version=NASB;KJV)
> We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. - [1 John 4:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A16&version=NASB;KJV)

our most natural reaction to something we dont like is to do something. but sometimes our actions can be very detrimental to our relationships *and*, most importantly to our walk with Christ Jesus our Lord 💗✝️🙏 one amazing quote i heard recently, and i dont know how much you agree with it, but i find it interesting and useful, here it goes:

> "We dont love GOD *and* other people, but we love GOD *by* (through) loving other people"

i love it honestly. if we remember that we all are created in the image of GOD and also the Words of Jesus Christ our Lord Almighty GOD praise the Lord our GOD King Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior our Holy Redeemer, Who said that when you did a good thing to the littlest of my children (people), you did it to Me, it all just clicks and this quote makes sense for me personally, i like it 💗✝️🙏

> Then God said, “Let Us make mankind in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth, and over every crawling thing that crawls on the earth.” So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. - [Genesis 1:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%201%3A26-27&version=NASB;KJV)
> For I was hungry, and you gave Me _something_ to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me _something_ to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.’ ... And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did _it_ for one of the least of these brothers _or sisters_ of Mine, you did _it_ for Me.’ - [Matthew 25:35-36,40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat+25%3A35-36%2C+40&version=NASB;KJV)

and so as we're all are being sanctified by the Holy Spirit who is in us, we surely cant even think of doing something bad to other people physically, however we might wanna say something to them. and oh man we dont even fully realise the power that our words have guys, this is true that the Holy Bible tells us, the Holy Spirit Himself speaking:

> Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit. - [Proverbs 18:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+18%3A21&version=NASB;KJV)

and also if we remember that the Lord our GOD King Jesus Christ our Almighty Savior being the Word of GOD, created the entire universe - everything there is and the is (being, existence of stuff) itself as we perceive and understand it, through His **Word** by speaking things into existence which only GOD can do, and then we see in the Gospel of John how the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, we understand the immense power that our words have. of course completely miserable and inconceivably small compared to the Power of GOD's Words, but still they hold a lot of weight and value, whether we realise it or not:

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. ... And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only _Son_ from the Father, full of grace and truth. - [John 1:1,14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1%2C14&version=NASB;KJV)

GOD our Lord Almighty King Jesus Christ confirms it by the following verses:

> that if you confess with your mouth Jesus _as_ Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; - [Romans 10:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A9&version=NASB;KJV)
> But I tell you that _for_ every careless word that people speak, they will give an account of it on _the_ day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” - [Matthew 12:36-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A36-37&version=NASB;KJV)

for **every** careless word we speak, we **will** give in account to the Lord our GOD King Jesus Christ the Everlasting Holy Perfect Righteous Creator of all things 💗✝️🙏 and maybe this is not for us - saved born-again believers in Christ Jesus our Lord, or it will be in some form we dont know about; in any case, we must remember that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of all wisdom, so let us fear the Lord our GOD who created us and who cares for us so deeply that He sent His own Son to redeem us - that is just how much He **loves** us, simply absolutely incredible, guys

> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction. - [Proverbs 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+1%3A7&version=NASB;KJV)
> “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. - [John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NASB;KJV)

and yeah GOD tells us that confession with our own words that we believe, trust in and love Jesus Christ and accept Him as our Lord and Savior is of course on purpose and it ties into the topic of the power of our words beautifully and perfectly 💗✝️🙏 by our words we are justified and by our words we are also condemned. beautiful. of course we understand that our words is only the result of our faith - faith alone is what saves, but without us having faith and the Holy Spirit we can simply never acknowledge Jesus Christ as GOD and our beloved Heavenly Father 💗✝️🙏

> Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed”; and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit. - [1 Corinthians 12:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2012%3A3&version=NASB;KJV)
> For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this _is_ not of yourselves, _it is_ the gift of God; - [Ephesians 2:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph%202%3A8&version=NASB;KJV)

but surely without us taking the first step towards GOD and acknowledging our horrible sinfulness and a desperate need for our Savior Jesus Christ and us inviting GOD into our hearts and thus receiving the Holy Spirit, none of that would've ever happened - meaning us acknowledging the Lord our GOD Jesus Christ for who He Is - our Wonderful Holy Perfect Savior and Redeemer - the Living GOD and the source of all goodness in our lives 💗✝️🙏

> For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.” - [Mark 8:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208%3A38&version=NASB;KJV)

thank You Jesus Christ our Lord Almighty GOD our Holy Perfect Righteous Savior and our Redeemer Lord GOD Most High King of Kings and Lord of Lords 💗✝️🙏 so, guys, as we naturally have a certain level of patience - and growing of course as we grow in GOD's grace, let us also remember that patience is not only not doing something directly, but also not saying something that might hurt others. GOD gifted us an amazing Book of James where we have some great verses on that in Chapter 3:
