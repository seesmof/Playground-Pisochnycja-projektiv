Єремії 12:6 Адже навіть твої брати, й родина твого батька, зраджують тебе, голосно лаючись услід тобі. Тому не довіряй їм, навіть коли по-доброму звертатимуться до тебе!

Єремії 12:17 Якщо ж не послухаються, то Я викоріню цей народ й назавжди його знищу, – говорить ГОСПОДЬ.

Єремії 13:11  Адже, як пояс прилягає до тіла людини, так Я наблизив до Себе весь рід Ізраїля і весь Юдин рід, – говорить ГОСПОДЬ, – аби вони були Моїм особливим народом – Моєю хвалою і славою, але вони не послухались.

Єремії 13:16 Віддайте славу ГОСПОДУ, вашому Богові, поки не потемніло і поки ще ваші ноги не почали спотикатись у сутінках на горах, – тоді будете очікувати світла, але Він оберне його на темноту, – перетворить на непроглядну темряву.

Єремії 13:22  І коли ти спитаєш себе: Чому все це мене спіткало? – то знай : через безліч твоїх гріхів піднято поділ твоєї спідниці, і оголені твої ноги  .

Єремії 13:26  Через те Я Сам підійму поділ твоєї спідниці аж на твоє обличчя, аби всі побачили твій сором.

Єремії 15:6 Ти відкинув Мене, – говорить ГОСПОДЬ, – повернувся до Мене спиною, тому Я простягнув Свою руку проти тебе і знищив тебе. Я втомився тебе жаліти!

Єремії 15:13  Твоє багатство та твої скарби Я віддам як здобич без викупу, за всі твої гріхи в межах усіх твоїх кордонів.

Єремії 15:15 Господи, Ти все знаєш! Згадай мене і заступися за мене, відплати за мене всім тим, котрі мене переслідують. Не дозволь їм мене погубити задля Твого довготерпіння. Ти знаєш, що заради Тебе я терплю ганьбу.

Єремії 15:20  Я зроблю тебе перед цим народом неприступним мідним муром, і, хоч вони воюватимуть з тобою, проте не зможуть подужати тебе, тому що Я буду з тобою, аби тебе визволяти й рятувати тебе, – говорить ГОСПОДЬ.

Єремії 16:19  ГОСПОДЬ, – сила моя та моя твердиня, – мій захист у лиху годину. До Тебе прийдуть народи від країв землі й скажуть: Дійсно, спадщина поведінки наших батьків – обман і марнота, від якої немає жодної користі.

Єремії 17:5  Так говорить ГОСПОДЬ: Проклята людина, яка покладається на іншу людину та вважає тіло своєю опорою, а серцем відвертається від ГОСПОДА!

Єремії 17:7  Проте благословенна людина, яка цілковито покладається на ГОСПОДА, і надією якої є ГОСПОДЬ.

Єремії 17:22  і не виносьте тягарів із ваших осель у суботній день, – і не виконуйте жодної праці, але святкуйте суботній день, як Я і заповів вашим батькам!

Матвія 12:30  Хто не зі Мною, той проти Мене, і хто зі Мною не збирає, той розкидає.

Матвія 12:36  Кажу ж вам, що за кожне пусте слово, яке люди скажуть, відповідатимуть судного дня, 37  бо за словами своїми будеш виправданий, і за словами своїми будеш осуджений.

Матвія 12:43   Коли нечистий дух виходить з людини, то блукає безводними місцями, шукаючи відпочинку, та не знаходить. 44 Тоді каже: Повернуся до свого дому, звідки вийшов. І, повернувшись, він знаходить його порожнім, заметеним і прибраним. 45  Він тоді іде, бере із собою сім інших духів, гірших від себе, і вони, ввійшовши, живуть там; і кінець тієї людини буває гірший від початку. Так буде і цьому злому родові.

Матвія 12:50  Адже хто чинитиме волю Мого Отця, Який на небі, той є Моїм братом, і сестрою, і матір’ю!

i hate to admit it, but i think im following Jesus because of fear mainly. i had a dream this night, it started with me sitting in some large auditorium in some educational facility, probably some university, and then the ground of the floor of the classroom split, just like it used to split in the Jerusalem i think back in the day when romans crucified Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. and we all evacuated, there was some black guy with me, we were all running down the stares and just went home. i never seen that black guy again in a dream, i dont think so at least. and i was walking with the people i knew earlier in my life and we were walking in line, i was in the middle and two of them were to my sides, but in front of us walked my so to say friend of the childhood, he was very skinny, i could clearly see all his ribs and his shoulder blades, as he was walking in front of us and when he turned around he had three tattoos on his torso i think, two on both of the breasts and one on the stomach, they were all demonic. he had a very negative evil and demonic presence or aura around him. and as we were walking we started talking about the afterlife and i dont remember much of the conversations at all but the guy in front of us was speaking confidently in how he's going to hell and seemed to be okay about it, and me and two of my friends started cautioning him about not joking about stuff like that, and they both walked closer to him to warn him that Jesus loves him and wants to help him, and that he doesnt want or have to go to hell, there's always hope in our God. and as they did that i started saying something along the lines of "Believe me, this place is as real as it gets, stop joking about it", and as i was saying "as real as it gets", i just started weeping and couldn't speak no more. thats when i literally woke up and probably even made some sound in real life too. im wondering what could it mean, maybe God is trying to communicate to me or something. i also remembered that when the floor split in the auditorium, i started praying to God to help us, guide us and rescue us, which was amazing, im so glad God is changing me in such profound ways that even in dreams i pray to Him, thats amazing, thank you so much my Lord and Savior Christ Jesus.

sometimes it can be quite hard to discern what God wants from me. like sometimes when i even pray i can ask something to God and He says one thing, then when i sort of dont like the answer i ask Him again, and He gives me another answer, and i keep asking to reassure myself that this is the answer, since its the answer that i wanna hear. 

i watched a video from a channel i like called IMBeggar on youtube, he was talking about how religion is for weak and how it is merely a coping mechanism. and i think it very well might be. people are all broken, especially in our country, and they're just trying to live by another day. some find their refuge in drugs, alcohol, sex, games, gambling, whatever. but, if i remove all the biases and speak truly from the bottom of my heart, i genuinely believe there is a God. Lord, i think i truly believe in you, which is amazing. because just the amount of sheer overwhelming joy that i get when i go outside and speak to people sometimes, and the amount of peace that i get knowing that God figured it all out, so to say, and has it all under control just gives me peace. thank you Jesus for giving me peace. yea, i never had that before. i used to masturbate almost everyday, play tons of video games, and live my life how i wanted, but that never lead me to a prolonged satisfaction, honestly. even now i think of masturbating again and the fact that the parents bought bananas, which i used to masturbate with back in the day once, really arouses me. however, i dont think those are necessarily my thoughts. i do believe there is an enemy of God and there are demons who are putting thoughts and desires into people's minds and i think this is exactly the case here. whenever i last masturbated, sure i felt good, but that was way not as intense as the joy that God gives me, and way not as lasting as the joy God gives me. so in here the choice is obvious, i will refrain for as long as i possibly can and hopefully, Lord if it is your will, Father, please make it so, i will not relapse ever again, until i meet my wife, my wonderful perfect spouse who will be sent to me from God and whom we will spend the rest of our lives with. this is honestly just such a better option. and yeah with her we can do all we would ever want. not whatever of course, we cannot bring any extras, so to say, no homosexuality, no zoophilia, nothing like that, God forbids that, but im quite certain we will be able to satisfy the desires of each other, which is a great clear beam of hope that i hold on to when it comes to such instantly gratifying but not lasting pleasures like from lust.

God is certainly testing me and my faith, and i pray again and again for Him, Father, please if it is your will, strengthen my faith to the never before seen levels once all the trials are over. you are just such a better option, Jesus, between you, Lord, and this world. this world is truly extremely wicked. i have been watching this guy Nick Johns i think was his name on youtube, he been posting tons of videos uncovering the demonic and horrible acts of people and companies of this world, the artists, so called, and the actors, all kinds of wicked people who are against you, God. and its been fun to watch for a while, but i think i'd be better off just focusing on the word of God honestly. because its fun and all, be we already know all this stuff. we dont have to get any reassurance that this world is completely fallen and wicked. so ill stop watching him, and will spend this time reading my Bible better instead.

one interesting thought i also heard or had sometimes earlier is if there truly is an evolution as science portrays it, that we evolved from apes and all that kinds of stuff, how is it that the world keeps getting worse with each year? very interesting thought and for me i think it just puts yet another nail in the coffin of our current understanding of the universe and the world around us. we truly know nothing. God knows everything. He is infinitely better than us and we must just rely on Him for everything. i keep getting reassured of that every time i go and work out. i feel completely exhausted, i feel like i can literally do zero pullups, zero pushups, zero squats, but i pray to the Lord before every set of my workout, and it always works out well.

yesterday i had a workout when i was, again, quite exhausted, not in the mood, all that sorts of stuff. and i prayed to our Lord for help and asked Him to just do it all for me, because i literally can do nothing right now. and i did the entire set of dumbbell bench presses completely with my eyes closed. you tell me now, what is it, if not a divine intervention. i just cannot find any other explanation to it. the other day i was training and the situation was identical completely - no energy, if not for God i would've just laid there all evening in my bed doing nothing. but of course i prayed again and our Lord literally been pulling me up when i was doing the pullups set. i came up to the bar with no energy, truly, and hang there and just started doing them. to my immense surprise, i did them effortlessly. of course the last ones are not without struggle, its always the case, but the first ones i did as if i was doing them my entire life every day couple of times a day. you tell me now, how is it not the intervention of God? it cannot not be, truly. 

so yeah, God is definitely real, my dream proves it once again, and all the miracles He's been doing in my life prove it again and again. so Lord Jesus, please forgive me any time i might doubt you. and i definitely had such times in the past, even in my walk with you, Lord, but those might not always be my thoughts. as i was telling you before, Lord, when i was in the clearest state of mind possible, all i want in this life and ever is to be with you, Father, i want you to come back on earth, Jesus, and to judge all the people on it as they deserve. you are, Lord, the ultimate judge, and you are, Jesus, the ultimate peacemaker. and i know you are testing me, Father, every day, and i kinda get why you're doing it. i of course can never fully comprehend your plans and your desires, but i sincerely wanna surrender myself to you and to just trust your wisdom. i, Lord, know nothing without you. i am nothing without you, Jesus, and i truly need you every second of every day for the rest of my life. Lord, i cannot wait when you will come back on earth, as was foretold in the Bible, which is your living word, the word of our God, the one and only true real God Christ Jesus, you will come back one day, will wipe every tear from the eyes of righteous, will remove all sorrow, all sin and make the earth a perfect place, as you, Lord, intended it to be from the very beginning. truly i tell you, Father, all and only hope is for you, Jesus. only you can rescue and help us, your sheep. the ultimate freedom is in surrender to you, Lord. the salvation is in knowing you love us, Lord, and you care and help us always. i genuinely fell deep in love with you, Jesus, and i am so glad for even the opportunity to say that. only thanks to you, Lord, i even converted back to Christianity, and i am so grateful for this amazing gift of yours. people are truly saved through your, Father, grace by faith, by our faith. i was searching for you, Lord, a long time, and i finally found you, Jesus, and i cannot be more happier. and even though my face might not align with what im saying now, because i am probably quite tired by now, but in my heart and in my soul i know that i love you, Jesus, more than anything ever. you are, Jesus, the source of all the good things in this world and in my life, and i can never thank you enough. so, Lord, whatever happens ever, in the very end i just want to be with you forever, God. i want to live with you, in your Heavenly Kingdom, Father. im ready to be a mere servant on your kitchen, Lord, or even a little piece of dust floating around your Kingdom, Lord. although i dont think there's any dust in the place where you reside, Father. but i am ready to be even the most miserable servant and to just be following you wherever you go, Jesus. this is truly my ultimate goal and my only true desire, Father, to be with you forever.

Киріє елейсон - Господи помилуй. помилуй мене, простого грішника. помилуй мою сім'ю, Боже. помилуй нашу країну, Господи. вся надія лише на тебе, Ісусе Христе 🙏💗✝️

Івана 4:14  а хто питиме воду, яку Я йому дам, не матиме спраги повік, бо вода, яку Я йому дам, стане в ньому джерелом води, що тече в життя вічне.

Івана 4:34  Каже їм Ісус: Моя пожива – чинити волю Того, Хто послав Мене, та довершити Його справу.

Єремії 25:5  Вони говорили: Зверніть кожен зі своєї лихої дороги й залиште ваші злі вчинки, аби й далі жити на землі, яку ГОСПОДЬ дав вам і вашим батькам на віки вічні.

Єремії 29:6 Одружуйтесь і народжуйте синів та дочок, – одружуйте ваших синів й віддавайте заміж ваших дочок, і нехай родяться у них діти, – намножуйтесь, і не зменшуйтеся!

Єремії 29:11  Адже лише Я знаю наміри, які Я маю щодо вас, – говорить ГОСПОДЬ, – наміри про ваш спокій, а не про лихо, аби забезпечити вас добробутом у майбутньому й надією.

Єремії 29:13  А коли будете Мене шукати, то знайдете, якщо шукатимете Мене всім вашим серцем.

Єремії 30:16  Проте ті, котрі тебе пожирають, самі будуть пожерті, і хто тебе пригноблював, – усі вони підуть у неволю. Всі твої грабіжники будуть пограбовані, а ті, для кого ти стала здобиччю, самі стануть здобиччю.

Єремії 30:17  Тобі ж, дочко Сіону, Я принесу зцілення і вилікую тебе від твоїх ран, – запевняє ГОСПОДЬ, – хоч тебе прозвали відкинутою, про яку ніхто вже ніколи не подбає.

Матвія 18:3  і сказав: Запевняю вас: якщо не навернетеся і не станете, як діти, не ввійдете в Царство Небесне.

Матвія 18:7  Горе світові від спокус, бо повинні прийти спокуси; однак горе тій людині, через яку спокуси приходять.

Матвія 18:8  Коли твоя рука або нога тебе спокушає, відрубай її і кинь геть від себе; краще тобі ввійти в життя кульгавим або кволим, ніж, маючи дві руки та дві ноги, бути вкинутим у вогонь вічний. 9  Коли твоє око тебе спокушає, вийми його й кинь від себе; краще тобі однооким увійти в життя, ніж, маючи два ока, бути вкинутим у вогняну геєну

Матвія 18:12   Як ви вважаєте? Коли в якогось чоловіка буде сто овець і одна з них заблукає, чи не покине він дев’яносто дев’ять у горах і не піде шукати заблудлої?

Матвія 18:19  Знову запевняю вас: коли двоє з вас на землі погодяться просити про будь‑яку річ, яку лише просять, буде їм дано від Мого Отця Небесного. 20  Адже де двоє або троє зберуться в Ім’я Моє, там і Я серед них!

Матвія 18:21  Тоді, підійшовши до Нього, Петро сказав: Господи, якщо згрішить мій брат проти мене, чи маю йому прощати до семи разів? 22  Відповів йому Ісус: Не кажу тобі до семи разів, але до сімдесяти разів по сім.

Матвія 18:35  Так і Мій Отець Небесний чинитиме з вами, якщо не простите від вашого серця кожний братові своєму (його переступів).
