Ісаї 5:11 Горе тим, котрі з самого ранку шукають п’янких напоїв, і до пізнього вечора розпалюються вином!

Ісаї 5:16 А Господь Саваот буде піднесений через суд, – Святий Бог виявить Свою святість у справедливості.

Ісаї 5:18 Горе тим, котрі тягнуть за собою гріхи, наче шнурами марноти, і беззаконня – наче мотузками від воза.

Ісаї 5:20-24 Горе тим, котрі зло величають добром, а добро – злом; котрі темряву вважають світлом, а світло – темрявою; котрі гірке називають солодким, а солодке – гірким. Горе тим, хто мудрий у власних очах і розумний перед самим собою. Горе тим, котрі хоробрі пити вино, й могутні у виготовленні міцних напоїв; котрі за хабарі виправдовують винуватого, а невинному відмовляють у справедливості.

> Glory to Jesus Christ 🙏 hey there buddy, the life has been the best it can possibly be on this earth honestly. oh man, there's so much to unpack and to talk about here, but lets of course start of by giving praise to our Lord and Savior Christ Jesus, our Holy Perfect God, oh Lord i am so so greatful to have You in my life, Father, my life has honestly never been the same since You came into it, oh Lord you're the best thing that could ever happen to me and i honestly just want one thing only - to be with You forever, Jesus 💗🙏 yeah, hopefully we will be one day. or rather surely we will reunite one day, when our appointed time comes, but while we are on earth, i am just so so greatful to You, Father, that you are taking care of us, me, my family, all the people i know, our country. Lord please let our country win over this horrible satanic kingdom of darnkess, in Jesus holy name i pray Lord amen 🙏 so yeah the life is just so incredible, i asked God some time ago to give me some people who are also Christians to talk to and He did, oh Lord i just cannot be thankful enough, this is so incredible, You are so incredible, Jesus, i love you so much. okay so yeah now i have Jordan who is from the UK, somewhere on the western coast of England, he's a Christian and he plays games form time to time. what i dont like about him and thats probably one of the only things is that he smokes weed, like on stream even, this is quite disturbing and i pray to you, Lord, that you, my holy God Jesus Christ, could help him battle this addiciton and to defeat it, in Jesus holy name i pray Lord amen 🙏 so yeah but his views on life are extremely positive, he is very sober, ironically a bit, when it comes to world politics and moscovia and generally this fallen world. and yea i really love talking to him about all kinds of stuff. oh, but the one thing i also dont like 😆 is how fast he talks. like he might ask me something, and while im answering he changes the topic and i have to answer that hahah so some of the questions are left unanswered indefinitely. but yeah he's a really fun guy and i love hanging out with him, thank you so much Jesus for such amazing people. and the second guy i found is Jacob, he's from Michigan i think in the US, he's also a cool guy, he's got a girlfriend, whom he's soon to propose i think, which is really exciting and i pray, Lord, that if those people are honoring you, Lord, and if they are righteous, you please take care of them and bless them, Father, because this Jacob guy is really fun and open to communications. what i also like about him is that he starts off his streams with the Bible verse of the day and from there on we usually talk about it in the chat and also read the entire chapter the verse is from together, which is just so amazing and im so greatful to you, Jesus my Lord, for this amazing opportunity 🙏 we're reading the NIV version on a website called Bible Getaway, real great website, i like it. but Bible.com is hard to beat honestly, cause there's just so many translations there. im reading the CUV or Біблія Сучасний переклад as they call it, its by Ukrainian Bible Society or Українське Біблійне Товариство, they i think also own the Огієнко version and the UTT version which is a thought for thought translation by Турконян i think was his last name, great stuff. i hope God will bless me with the opportunity to read the Bible once again once i finish it in CUV but in UTT fully next time, that would be great. but yeah man like i said i just cannot imagine how much better this life can be honestly. im literally sitting here chilling all day long every day of the week, i am at such great immense incomprehensible peace, i tell you, i have never ever felt anything like that before. oh man, just the realization that the Creator of all things, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, is literally walking with you and lives within you in form of the Holy Spirit is just the best thought ever, oh i am so happy, Jesus, thank you so so much, Father. oh Lord yeah this life is amazing and i cannot even imagine how much more amazing the Heavens will be, which is our true home. yeah, wow, i just love you so much my Lord, this is incredible. i wanna be with you forever, Jesus, truly 🙏 and as for some of the important news, i started translating the Bible.com app or website, they accepted me into their localization team which im so greatful for, Lord, and now i can help translate all kinds of materials from english to Ukrainian oh i love that, thakn you so much Jesus for this amazing opportunity, Lord, i love you so much. but yea i created a habit for myself to translate at least one string per day and thats great, real low effort, but it feels so great honestly, i just love helping people Lord and if its your will, Jesus, please bless me with everything i need to help people as much as i can. and yeah, its been just so great honestly, im so greatful for all i have, Jesus, you're the greatest ever, thank you Lord, genuinely. not to say that the walk has been easy or anything, not at all honestly, i been battling lust for quite a long time and thanks God i think we're on the final stages of curing it. like earlier on i was just obsessed with my anus and playing with it and sticking all sorts of things in it, and even still it arouses me, sure, but thanks to Jesus He gave me all the self control and mental clearness that i need to resist those temptations and to live life outside of sin. and that was honestly one of my biggest sins, but thanks God i really hope and pray we're about to defeat it for good. but yeah He also healed my anal so that its not open all the time and it doesnt itch anymore. i used to be filming it with my phone to sort of see whats going on there, but that was no good, i ended up looking at it too much to the point where i just gave in, shoved my deoderant bottle into it, and literally was filming the entire process of me doing it and the point of cumming as well. that was just horrible and i am so so sorry for it, Jesus, i hope and pray we will never do that again. but yeah thanks God He guided me and told me to delete all of it immediately and im so greatful for that cause that was such a shame even to myself. but yeah i also, like i mentioned earlier, went on some very horrible shameful websites on the deep web to see something absolutely horrifying that i wish i would've never done and again at that point also almost gave in and came while looking at those pictures. i prayed this morning for God to cure this horrible tendency in me and He told me that He did, and i of course believe Him. and to be fair, i dont even want that anymore like at all, this just feels disgusting to me to even think about so yeah, glory to God, our alpowerful almighty King of Kings Christ Jesus, thakn you so much, Father. but yea that was a bit of recalling past horrible sins, i pray and hope Lord forgives me all of those and i am deeply ashamed and regretful of doing them in the first place. but so far so great, we're on the final stretch i think and God will help us defeat lust once and for good. cause sexuality was obviously designed by our Lord to please and unite with our spouce, which i also pray God will send me one day because i of course want to grow our population and continue my heritage into the future. but yeah each time i see kids on the streets these days, man i just pray for God to take care of them and bring them up well so that they dont grow up listening to moscovian propaganda but instead become true faithful belivers and soldiers of Christ, and of course patriots of their country 🇺🇦 so yeah, i also wanted to talk about a dream i had, but now i feel kinda down for some reason. Lord please help me figure out why. because i started recalling those sins and that brought me down? oh yeah probably. Lord, im sorry, please forgive me, Jesus. in Jesus holy name i pray Lord amen 🙏 yeah i think lets just not beat ourselves up cause of that, cause God knows us, God loves us and He knows exactly what we need. but yea even thinking about the stuff i did is just so horrible. but lets not, for God, lets not think of that, and i rebuke those enemy thoughts in Jesus holy name. okay, lets focus on the positive side of life, which we are on right now. thakns God we are alive, we are healthy, we have our family, we dont have to work yet to make a living, God provides us with all we need day to day and life is just great man, so lets never forget it and be always thankful to Lord for taking care of us. thakn you Jesus so so much. okay the dream was really dumb, i was with Пашкульський Денис, my former classmate in some sort of fascility outside the city, and that was in some future im guessing, cause everything looked too neat and tidy for it to be our times. and so yeah we were in this fascility, might be military, but we werent in the military, we were just there as civilians maybe getting some documents or whatever. and there was some friend of his who was very out there, very sociable, but also a bit proud i think. i dont remember the conversations anymore, but i think at one point he took my bad and for some reason emptied it on the floor, which was weird. and then when we were inside he was singing i guess and at one moment of the song he just came up to me, i was staying right beside him and a group of his friends i guess while he was singing, and he just spit it my face for no reason hahahaah that was real weird, but i immediately tackled him on the floor and started beating his face up. that was honestly a horrible dream, i dont know why i have that, Lord, but yeah i just started beating him and once he already was probably unconcious i hit him a few more time, i think in total it was like around 20 times right in the face. yeah man that was a really violent dream. and all the people there got really scared of course, they were all trying to help him and stuff and i just started packing my things. i noticed that my bag was completely full, so i either must've packed it all up or he didnt empty it at all hahah no idea, but yeah it was dark outside by that time and i saw a moscovian made care speading away from the parking lot right outside of this fascility and i calmly walked off, and started heading towards my home. i dont know how i knew where my home was or whatever, but i saw this map in my dream, as if i was seeing it while i was walking, and it was really beautiful, the entire roadway system and the city itself looked amazing, as if in the far future indeed, there were lots of water bodies all around the city and tons of greenery, real great. and the major roads, at least in the area where i was at the time were forming a sort of circle, kinda like a peninsula with the outside road forming a circle, and on the bottom left corner of it there was an exit of this district i assume with intertwining couplet system, it was so beautiful. and yeah as i was walking down that street, some quiet modern 2-lane street with white lights to both sides and also some duplex buildings to both sides of it, the bag on my back didnt feel heavy at all and i think i started praying in my mind right at that moment, in a dream, for Jesus to help me get home ahahah that was so cool, yea i think i did that, i prayed right in my dream, thats amazing, and at that moment i just started running as if i dont weigh nothing, oh God that was beautiful, and yeah that dream ended there i think. but yeah thanks Goodness for  those amazing, even though a bit disturbing dreams at times, i am so greatful i can see, speak, walk, hear, smell and im all good and my family is all good, all thanks to you Jesus, thakn you so much, Father, we put our faith and trust in You only, Lord, thank you 🙏 

Ісаї 10:1 Горе тим, котрі створюють несправедливі закони, і писарям, які пишуть жорстокі постанови, 2 позбавляючи бідних правосуддя та урізуючи права Мого вбогого народу, щоби вдови ставали здобиччю, і можна було грабувати сиріт.
